"""SC builder module to build simplicial complex networks using
0-simplicies (nodes), 1-simplices (edges) and 2-simplicies (triangles).

The 2-simplices can be added in three ways:
    - Triangles passed as an argument.
    - All triangles in the simplicial complex.
    - Triangles based on a condition e.g. distance.
