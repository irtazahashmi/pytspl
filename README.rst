PyTSPL: Topological Signal Processing and Learning in Python
============================================================
The PyTSPL python package is a library for Topological Signal Processing and Learning. It is a 
free software distributed under the MIT license and available on PyPI. The documentation is available
on `Read the Docs <https://pytspl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and development takes place on
`GitHub <https://github.com/irtazahashmi/pytspl>`_.


Currently, the PyTSPL facilitates the functionalities for simplicial complexes but the aim is to
extend the library for additional topological learning functionalities.

**Simlicial complexes (SC):**


Installation
