## Source  
Provided by Rolf Möhring (TU Berlin) Andreas Schulz (MIT), and Nicolas Stier-Moses (Columbia University) with the assistance of Stefan Gnutzmann (DaimlerChrysler). These networks were used, among other things, in the paper by O. Jahn, R.H. Möhring, A.S. Schulz, and N. Stier-Moses titled "System-Optimal Routing of Traffic Flows with User Constraints in Networks with Congestion" (Operations Research, 53:4, 600-616, 2005). The original format of these files is slightly different from the other networks, and it is described in the readme file included in the packet.
